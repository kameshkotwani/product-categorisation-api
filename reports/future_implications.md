# Further Tools/Techniques which can be test

1. Leveraging CLIP for Multiâ€‘Modal Learning
2. Text Vectorisation (TF-IDF) for Name (will test once I have set up normal model and all)
3. Train our own CNN model using a pre-trained model to further increase accuracy.
4. Use sklearn class_weight to generate class_weight to get further more accuracy.


# Findings:

1. Some image url out of the 1500 values, giving Access Denied Error


# Opportunities

1. Train our own cosmetics products CNN model.
